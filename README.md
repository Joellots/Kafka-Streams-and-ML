# 🎯 Real-Time Data Analysis with Kafka Streams and Machine Learning

This project implements a **fraud detection system** using **Apache Kafka** for real-time data streaming and **machine learning** for transaction classification. It offers an end-to-end pipeline for ingesting, processing, and analyzing financial transactions in real time, with an intuitive **dashboard** for monitoring.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🌀 **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Low-latency Kafka pipeline for processing financial transactions.
- 🤖 **Fraud Detection with ML**: A machine learning model with **98% accuracy** for identifying fraudulent transactions.
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with **Streamlit** to visualize transaction flows and predictions in real-time.
- 🚀 **Scalable Architecture**: Fault-tolerant and distributed design using Kafka's partitioning and replication.

## 📐 Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](path/to/architecture-image.png)

1. **Producers**: Simulated real-time financial transactions streamed into Kafka.
2. **Kafka Streams**: Process transaction data in real time.
3. **ML Model**: Classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.
4. **Dashboard**: Monitor and analyze transactions via a **Streamlit** interface.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Apache Kafka**: Distributed messaging and real-time data processing.
- **Python**: Kafka integration and ML model implementation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Model training and prediction.
- **Streamlit**: Dashboard development for real-time monitoring.
- **Docker**: For deploying Kafka and Zookeeper.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- Python 3.8+ with `venv` support.

### 🛠️ Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Joellots/Kafka-Streams-and-ML.git
   cd Kafka-Streams-and-ML
   ```

2. Start Kafka and Zookeeper using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Set up the Python environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python kafka_streamlit.py
   ```

5. Open the dashboard:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

## 🎮 Usage

- 🖥️ The **dashboard** shows real-time transaction data and fraud detection results.  
- 🌀 **Producer and consumer**: The application independently manages the streaming pipeline. No manual starting of producers or consumers is required.

---

## 📊 Results

- **Accuracy**: Achieved **98%** precision in detecting fraudulent transactions.
- **Real-Time Latency**: Transactions are processed with minimal delay.
- **Scalability**: Successfully handles high transaction loads.

---

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- 🧠 Integrate advanced fraud detection models (e.g., deep learning).  
- 📡 Use **Kafka Connect** for easier database integration.  
- 🔔 Add automated alerting for detected fraud cases.
